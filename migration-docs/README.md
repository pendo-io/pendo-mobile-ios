# Migration Instructions From 2.x to 3.x 

Follow our migration instructions to solve breaking changes when upgrading from SDK version 2.x to 3.0:

- [Native Android](/migration-docs/android-2.x-to-3.x-migration.md)
- [Native iOS](/migration-docs/ios-2.x-to-3.x-migration.md)
- [React Native](/migration-docs/react-native-2.x-to-3.x-migration.md)
- [Xamarin Forms](/migration-docs/xamarin-forms-2.x-to-3.x-migration.md)
- [MAUI](/migration-docs/maui-2.x-to-3.x-migration.md)
- [Flutter](/migration-docs/flutter-2.x-to-3.x-migration.md)

Xamarin iOS and Xamarin Android are no longer supported in 3.x. Please move to MAUI or Xamarin Forms SDKs. This requires creating a new Pendo App and recapturing the app pages and features.
