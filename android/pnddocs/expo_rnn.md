## Expo using React Native Navigation

### 1. Add Pendo dependency
### Requirements: 
We support a codeless solution for EXPO Sdk 41+ and React Native Navigation 6+.<br>
Note that for the codeless solution to work, all the elements *MUST be wrapped in react-native ui components*.<br>
As with other analytics tools, we are dependent on react-navigation [screen change callbacks](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/screen-tracking/)
which means that codeless tracking analytics is available for screen components only.

In the root folder of your expo app, run the following:

```
npx expo install rn-pendo-sdk
```
OR use one of your package managers 
```
npm i rn-pendo-sdk  
yarn add rn-pendo-sdk
```
### 2. Project Setup
In the `app.json`, add the following:
```
"plugins": [
      [
        "rn-pendo-sdk",
        {
          "ios-scheme": "YOUR_IOS_URL_SCHEME",
          "android-scheme": "YOUR_ANDROID_URL_SCHEME"
        }
      ]
    ]
```
This configuration allows pendo to enter pair mode to tag pages and features. 

### 3. Production Bundle - Modify Javascript Obfuscation
In the `metro.config.js` file, add the following:
```typescript
module.exports = {
  transformer: {
    // ...
    minifierConfig: {
        keep_classnames: true, // Preserve class names
        keep_fnames: true, // Preserve function names
        mangle: {
          keep_classnames: true, // Preserve class names
          keep_fnames: true, // Preserve function names
        }
    }
  }
}
```
### 4. Integration
In the application main file (App.js/.ts/.tsx), add the following code:
```typescript
function initPendo() {
    const navigationOptions = {library: NavigationLibraryType.ReactNativeNavigation, navigation: Navigation};
    const pendoKey = 'YOUR_APPKEY_HERE';
    //note the following API will only setup initial configuration, to start collect analytics use start session
    PendoSDK.setup(pendoKey, navigationOptions);
}
```
Initialize Pendo Session where your visitor is being identified (e.g. login, register, etc.).
```typescript
const visitorId = 'John Smith';
const accountId = 'Acme Inc.';
const visitorData = {'Age': 25, 'Country': 'USA'};
const accountData = {'Tier': 1, 'Size': 'Enterprise'};

PendoSDK.startSession(visitorId, accountId, visitorData, accountData);
```

### 5. Running the project
To run the project with Pendo integration, you should be able to generate iOS and Android projects.
You can generate them by running `npx expo prebuild`, or `npx expo run:[ios|android]` (which will run prebuild automatically). You can also use development builds in this context - the easiest way to do this is to run `npx expo install expo-dev-client` prior to prebuild or run, and it's also possible to add the library at a later time (Additional information can be found here: [Adding custom native code](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/#generate-native-projects-with-prebuild) )

### 6. Verify Installation

1. In the Pendo UI, go to Settings>Subscription Settings.
2. Hover over your app and select View app details.
3. Select the Install Settings tab and follow the instructions under Verify Your Installation to ensure you have successfully integrated the Pendo SDK.
4. Confirm that you can see your app as Integrated under <a href="https://app.pendo.io/admin" target="_blank">subscription settings</a>.

## Limitations 
**Expo Go** is not supported by Pendo because Pendo SDK has a native plugin tjat is not part of the Expo Go app.
Pendo can be used in development builds **only**. 
You can read more about development builds here [Adding custom native code with development builds].(https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/)

## Pivots
Pay attention to the following APIs, ``` setup ``` and ```startSession```; the former *must* be called once per session and it creates an initial setup for the SDK, the latter should be called when you have the visitor you would like to assign the analytics/guides to. If you want an anonymous visitor, pass ```nil``` to the ```startSession``` and call it again as soon as you have the visitor.  

## Limitations
* To support hybrid mode with React Native Navigation, open a ticket.
