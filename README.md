The Pendo Mobile SDK is a code-less, retro-active analytics collector across all of your app versions. The SDK allows presentation of in-app messages, tooltips and multi-step walkthrough guides built using Pendo's Visual Design Studio.

* The integration requires only a few lines of code.

* The SDK will start collecting analytics once the SDK is integrated.

* Analytics and guides will work across all your app versions.

## Benchmarks
The SDK will increase the size of your production app (on App Store) by roughly _2.3MB_<br>
A typical Pendo session payload, including calling  `setup` and `startSession` and downloading 3 guides will consume about _~80KB _ of data can take around _3sec_.<br>
Network requests are executed in parallel, prioritizing guides with higher priority to be downloaded first and becoming available earlier during the initialization process of the session.
