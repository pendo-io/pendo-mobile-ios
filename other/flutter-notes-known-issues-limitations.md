## Navigation Libraries
The page recognition solution supports the standard Flutter Navigator, GoRouter and AutoRoute libraries. Integration with additional navigation frameworks is planned for future releases.

## Clickable Widgets
Our implementation supports basic touch interactions (touchDown and touchUp) on a range of standard Flutter widgets, including:<br>
InkResponse, InkWell, GestureDetector<br>
ButtonStyleButton, FloatingActionButton, IconButton, MaterialButton<br>
PopupMenuButton, DropdownButton, Checkbox, Chip, ChoiceChip, FilterChip, InputChip, Switch, Radio, ListTile<br>
TabBar, BottomNavigationBar, SelectableText, TextField<br>
Support for more complex interaction types (e.g. Drag and Swipe gestures) is planned for future releases.
