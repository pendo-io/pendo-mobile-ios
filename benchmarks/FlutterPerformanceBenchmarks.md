## Performance benchmarks

These measurements of the SDK are captured using Pendoâ€™s testing applications and may differ among applications, depending on their screen complexity and user interaction.

### SDK performance

|                | Size Impact | Memory Impact | CPU Impact\* |
|     :---:      |     :---:   |     :---:     |    :---:     |   
|    Flutter     |   103KB\*\* | (~) 60-200KB  |     LOW      |

<b>\*</b> Slight CPU impact may occur during app launch or UI-intensive operations.
<b>\*\*</b> 103KB reffers to the Flutter plugin size while iOS native SDK size is ~6MB, Android native SDK size is ~3MB.

### SDK network usage
**Outgoing traffic**

The analytics captured by the SDK include starting a session, the application state (foreground and background), screen changing, clicks, guide events, and manual track events. 
The size of each analytic event varies from 1KB to 9KB.
